{"text_prompts":[{"text":"Create a captivating image that prominently features [${recipeEngString}] in exquisite detail. The dish should be the star of the photo, with a sharp, detailed close-up that highlights its textures, colors, and intricate presentation. Every aspect of the dish, from the glisten of the sauce to the garnish's placement, needs to be vivid and sharply focused, showcasing the dishâ€™s gourmet quality. In the background, include a tasteful arrangement of culinary tools and elements like a chef's knife, a wooden cutting board, a small herb plant, and some high-end cooking utensils, all contributing to the atmosphere of a professional kitchen. These background elements should be subtly blurred, ensuring that they complement the dish without overshadowing it. The lighting should be deep and bright, perfectly illuminating the dish and accentuating its details. The image should be devoid of any text, capturing the high-end, polished look of a culinary masterpiece in a sophisticated kitchen setting."}],"cfg_scale":7,"height":1024,"width":1024,"samples":1,"steps":30}
